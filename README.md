# Strategic Customer Segmentation Decision System

A multi-dimensional customer segmentation framework designed to guide marketing investment, targeting strategy, and budget allocation in a large-scale e-commerce environment.

---

## 1. Business Problem

Marketing investments were being allocated without a unified customer value and behavior framework.

Key questions:
- Which customers drive long-term profitability?
- How should marketing budget be allocated across segments?
- How do behavioral, transactional, and psychographic signals interact?
- How can segmentation improve ROI while reducing waste?

---

## 2. Strategic Objective

Design a scalable segmentation system to:

- Align targeting with profitability
- Reduce inefficient marketing spend
- Improve campaign precision
- Enable budget reallocation decisions
- Support executive-level planning

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

The system integrates five dimensions:

1. Demographics  
2. Transactional  
3. Behavioral  
4. Psychographics  
5. CX & Engagement  

Each dimension was engineered independently and later integrated into a unified segmentation layer.

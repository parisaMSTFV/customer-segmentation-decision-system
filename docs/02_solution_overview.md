# Solution Overview

The segmentation system was designed as a multi-dimensional decision layer integrating five core perspectives:

1. Demographics
2. Transactional behavior
3. Behavioral engagement
4. Psychographic signals
5. CX & feedback metrics

Each dimension was engineered independently using structured feature extraction and clustering logic, and later integrated into a unified segmentation output.

Architecture layers:

- Data extraction (SQL feature engineering)
- Dimension-level clustering
- Integrated scoring & business rule alignment
- BI visualization and stakeholder reporting
- Monitoring and iteration framework

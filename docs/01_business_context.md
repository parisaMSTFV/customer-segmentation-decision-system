# Business Context

In large-scale e-commerce environments, marketing investment decisions often suffer from fragmented customer definitions and inconsistent performance signals.

Key challenges:
- Lack of unified customer value definition
- Budget allocation not aligned with profitability
- Over-targeting low-value segments
- Underutilization of behavioral and lifecycle signals

This project was designed to create a decision-oriented customer segmentation system that aligns marketing targeting, personalization, and budget allocation with measurable business impact.

Primary decision areas supported:
- Targeting and personalization strategy
- Campaign investment allocation
- Budget re-distribution across segments
- ROI improvement and waste reduction
